# Kaggle_Competition_Practice
The purpose of this repository is for me to practice doing kaggle competitions. Most of the repository will consist of me trying to replicate the solutions of podium placers on kaggle. Most of the code of this repository is therefore very similar or derivative of someone elses and credit will be included in every folder.
