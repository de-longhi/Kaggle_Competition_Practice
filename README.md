# Kaggle_Competition_Practice
The purpose of this repository is for me to practice participating in Kaggle competitions. Most of the repository will consist of me attempting to replicate the solutions of podium placers on Kaggle. Therefore, most of the code in this repository is very similar or derivative of someone else's, and credit will be included in every folder.
